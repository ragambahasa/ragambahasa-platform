[RagamBahasa]() is part of "research collaboration starting in 2022" that focuses on the field of _Natural Language Processing (NLP)_. RagamBahasa is a 'home' for collaborator and contributor of Indonesian local language resources to work together to preserve local languages through digitizing analog resources (newspapaer, magazine, manuscript, books, etc) of Indonesian local language. In its development, RagamBahasa also supports efforts to collect local language resources in digital form that are widely distributed on the internet, so that they can be easily found when needed.

This research funded by [The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (MoECRT)](https://www.kemdikbud.go.id/) collaborating with [Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education Agency](https://lpdp.kemenkeu.go.id/)
